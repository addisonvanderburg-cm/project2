Whats in the code: 
- First page
    - Get started
- Add subscription
- Delete subcription
- Categories
- Outputs the spending health
- Highlights the spendings over 20 in red
    - Thresholds for spendings 
- Error checkers 

What it needs: 
- Background to be changed to have a different color than textbox
- Once in the second page dont have the top button
    - Make it a textbox that says subscription manager
- It has to be hex code not the color name 
- Needs to be sorted so that we can sort by specific catigories. 
- See your spending price for weekly, monthly and yearly. 

What you need to do: 

Replace all background colors with HEX color codes instead of named colors.
Ensure the background color contrasts visibly with textbox backgrounds.
Remove or adjust the “Get Started” button so it does not appear once the manager page loads.
Confirm that the second page correctly displays a title textbox or label reading “Subscription Manager.”
Add sorting controls to the GUI (buttons or a dropdown menu) for:
Sort by category
Sort alphabetically
Sort by cost (low to high, high to low)
Add GUI controls that allow switching between weekly, monthly, and yearly spending views.
Add category filtering controls to the interface.
Ensure the Listbox updates visually after sort, filter, add, or delete actions.
Ensure error messages and status labels display correctly based on outputs from logic.py.
